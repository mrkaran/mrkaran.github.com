<h2>CODED BRAINS TO CHORDED HEARTS:</h2>
<h4>
“Humans rule the world”- that is past, that is history. Correction – “technology rules the world”. Our present world where long distances are overridden into a matter of minutes with a speed of 1228 kmph and a time span of microsecond is considered outdated is the beginning of the new era of technology. It is time to get your nerds on and rethink to establish even a better future, to take the advancement of human thoughts to a new threshold. This year’s theme CODED BRAINS TO CHORDED HEARTS has been introduced after going over the accelerated technological up-gradation in our generation. GCELT presents this year’s techno creative fest in a view to further refine the technical skills and cultivate the creative flair of the students.

<h2>GREETINGS AND WELCOME TO ENGINERDS 2K15</h2>


<h4>Keeping up to the legacy of GCELT since 2011, after four successful years of response and effective cultivation of profound knowledge, this year again we present “Enginerds”, our annual techno-creative fest to sneak a quick look into the wizard inside you in order to bring out the expert engineer. We believe technical knowledge is not enough. One must transcend techniques so that the technology becomes a timeless art, growing out of the unconscious. Therefore apart from technical scrimmage we have creative events up in the table.ENGINERDS has endeavoured to bring to light some extremely talented students with proficient technical skills and innovative minds. We are pleased having been able to provide such a forum where students can exploit their potential to the fullest. ENGINERDS has consistently attracted some of the best talent and minds in the city, in part because they enjoy the fest’s competition and also because they know they will get to see and acquire plenty of rare working knowledge in different fields through participation and being audience to the diverse techno-creative events.<br/>
GCELT invites every student to participate in the series of events to probe into your intellect and win attractive prize money.
